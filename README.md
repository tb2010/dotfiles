Basic configuration files

This repository is the current config files I use.

I have made this to be common across my multiple machines,

I will be working hard to keep personal info seperate.

OS specific settings will be identified and automated where possible.

Files that end with -base should be copied and edited instead of linked.

To override the the set the HOST variable in ~/.localrc along with any other settings
that you want to keep private.
